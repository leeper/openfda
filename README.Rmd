# R Client Library for openFDA #

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leeper/openFDA.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/leeper/openFDA)

This is a placeholder for an R client to access data for the [openFDA](http://open.fda.gov/) initiative of the [United States Food and Drug Administration](http://www.fda.gov/). At this point the site and API are not live. Stay tuned!

Note: The API is currently in beta release. Data within the openFDA API is Public Domain and released under Creative Commons CC0.

## Installation ##

**openFDA** is [available on GitHub](http://github.com/leeper/openFDA) and can (soon) be installed from within R from your favorite CRAN mirror:

```
install.packages("openFDA")
```

And the latest development version, available here, can be installed directly using  [devtools](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html):

```
# install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
install_github("leeper/openFDA")
```

## Setup ##

The openFDA API is accessible without an API key (with limits of 40 requests/minute and 1000 requests per day). An API key is free, can be generated [here](http://open.fda.gov/api/reference/), and increases limits to 120 requests/minute and 60000 requests per day.

Storing the API key in: `options('openfda_key' = 'APIKEYHERE')` loads the key automatically in all **openFDA** function calls.

## Code Examples ##

Coming soon!
